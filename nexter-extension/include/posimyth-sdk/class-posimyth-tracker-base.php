/**
 * POSIMYTH Analytics — shared client tracker base.
 *
 * Ship this file UNCHANGED inside every POSIMYTH plugin's `include/posimyth-sdk/`
 * folder. Each plugin provides a tiny subclass (Posimyth_Tracker_NE / _TPAE / _TPGB)
 * that only declares plugin-specific keys. All collection, scanning, consent-gating
 * and transport lives here so the three plugins never drift apart.
 *
 * Privacy: this payload carries no email, no IP, no user names and no post content.
 *
 * It DOES carry the site URL, and the hub stores that URL in plaintext so support can tell which
 * install a report came from. Earlier revisions of this comment said the hub only kept a one-way
 * SHA-256 hash of it; that was wrong — the hub's hash is a row-dedup key that sits alongside the
 * raw value, not a substitute for it. Do not describe this data as anonymous.
 *
 * The one exception to "no email" is the deactivation dialog's "I agree to be contacted" opt-in,
 * which attaches the admin email — and only when the user ticks that box. See
 * Posimyth_Deactivation_Survey::handle_ajax().
 *
