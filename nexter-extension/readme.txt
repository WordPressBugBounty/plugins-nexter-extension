== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will This Work With All Themes? =
No, it won‚Äôt. Nexter Builder is specifically developed for Nexter WordPress Theme but also supports other popular themes like Hello Elementor, Astra, GeneratePress, OceanWP, Kadence, Blocksy, and Neve.
= Why Did We Make This Plugin Separately? =
We Wanted to Include All These Features in Nexter Theme Itself, as They‚Äôre Our Primary Concern & Concept for Nexter WordPress Theme. But Respecting Rules & Regulations of WordPress Platform and Theme Submission Protocols, We Found a Way to Continue Serving High-Quality Products by Appending Nexter Extensions to Theme Package.
Only If You Want to Geek Out : 
We Wanted to Include This in Theme Itself as This is a Part of Theme Itself. WordPress Have Considered Functions Like Register_post_type() in Plugin Territory, So We Couldn't Include That in the Theme. They Did This With Purpose, You May [Read It Here](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/#more-information).

= How can I report security bugs?
You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/nexter-extension)
